# liri-node-app
<br>I've built a language interpretation application that will take certain specified node commands to return results from spotify, omdb, or concerts in town.
<br>to use liri open terminal and navigate to your directory containing liri, then in terminal type node liri.js input command
<br>input can be concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this, or do-what-it-says
<br>command will be your desired search parameter, i.e. a band, song, or movie
<br>a full example would be node liri.js concert-this red hot chili peppers
