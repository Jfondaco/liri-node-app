# liri-node-app
#I've built a language interpretation application that will take certain specified node commands to return results from spotify, omdb, or concerts in town.
#to use liri open terminal and navigate to your directory containing liri, then in terminal type node liri.js input command
#input can be concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this, or do-what-it-says
#command will be your desired search parameter, i.e. a band, song, or movie
#a full example would be node liri.js concert-this red hot chili peppers
